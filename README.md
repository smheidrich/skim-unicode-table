## Installation

**NOTE:** If prebuilt wheels are not available for your operating system,
installation will take a long time and use a lot of space because it has to
compile skim from scratch.

```bash
pip install skim-unicode-table
```

If you want enlarged character previews like in the demo video above to work,
you'll also have to install [atanunq's viu][2] and make sure it can be found
from `PATH`.
